message: "I also had no idea that `ForEach-Object` supported `-WhatIf` this way. I do have one scenario where this would be very handy. \r\n\r\nOne lesser known feature of `ForEach-Object` is that it has an alternate parameter set that takes just a string. If that maps to a property name on the object, you will get the value. If it maps to a method on the object, it will get executed. So, you can use `-WhatIf` in this way:\r\n\r\n    Get-Process slack | % Close -WhatIf\r\n\r\nI would never use this magic in a script, but I use it all the time when on the console. I can now see myself using `-WhatIf` like this quite often. \r\n\r\nThank you for pointing this out."
