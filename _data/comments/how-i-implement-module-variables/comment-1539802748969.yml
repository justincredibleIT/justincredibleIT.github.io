  Hi Dave, I sometimes include a set of functions specifically for module
  variable management in my modules, especially during development since it
  let's me not have to use the debugger quite as often. These functions let one
  add, remove, set, view module variable on demand.  I started out with a proof
  of concept module simply called
  [ModuleVariablesPOC](https://github.com/exactmike/ModuleVariablesPOC).
